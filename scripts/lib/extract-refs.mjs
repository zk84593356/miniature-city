// extract-refs.mjs — THE asset-reference extractor: every URL shape a mirror
// has to be able to see in a text file. Shared by mirror-site.mjs (pass 1, the
// BFS crawl) and verify-mirror.mjs (pass 4, the static closure gate).
//
// It lives in lib/ for the same reason lib/urlpath.mjs does: when the crawler
// and the closure gate carry separate copies of these regexes, the gate cannot
// see the references the crawler cannot see, so the closure check reports
// "reference set − disk set = ∅" while both sides share one blind spot. A gate
// that inherits the bug it is auditing is worse than no gate.
//
// ⚠ THE LINE ABOVE IS A CLAIM, AND IT IS CHECKABLE — CHECK IT【objectarchive N12】
//     grep -l "lib/extract-refs.mjs" scripts/*.mjs
// must list exactly the callers named here. On the project that wrote this
// module, that same header sentence was true of the gate and FALSE of the
// crawler, which kept a private copy of the shapes for four milestones. A file
// header states intent; only an import statement states code, and a header that
// claims sharing while one caller has its own copy is worse than no claim —
// it makes the next fix land on one side and read as landed on both.
//
// Shapes covered, and why each one is here:
//   1. absolute            https://host/path
//   2. protocol-relative   //host/path        (quoted or parenthesised)
//   3. root-relative       src=/path.ext      on the origin itself
//   4. srcset candidates   see below — the one that hides hundreds of files
//   5. relative url(...)   inside CSS, resolved against the stylesheet's URL
//
// …and every one of them is run TWICE: once over the file's bytes, once over a
// DECODED VIEW of them (see "THE ESCAPED-URL BLIND SPOT" below).
//
// (4) is the field lesson. `srcset` / `imagesrcset` are COMMA-SEPARATED
// CANDIDATE LISTS, and only the FIRST candidate is preceded by the quote that
// shapes (1)–(3) key on; every later one starts after ", ". Measured on
// objectandarchive.com: 68 srcsets × ~5 candidates, so ~270 responsive variants
// were invisible to pass 1 — while the ledger looked complete, because the
// first candidate of every set was present. Paired with a pathname-only url ->
// path mapping (lib/urlpath.mjs) this is undetectable downstream: the page
// renders from whichever variant did land.
//
// THE ESCAPED-URL BLIND SPOT — why the second pass exists【objectarchive D-T10】
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Shape (1)'s character class excludes backslash, on purpose: a URL match must
// stop at an escape boundary. The consequence nobody drew: a URL SPELLED with
// escapes never starts matching at all. `https:\/\/host\/path` — what a
// template engine's JSON filter emits inside an inline payload (Liquid
// `| json`, PHP `json_encode`, `JSON.stringify` piped through an HTML escaper)
// — dies at the first `\/`, and the whole class of references is invisible.
// Same for `\/\/host\/path`, for the double-escaped `https:\\/\\/…` that comes
// out of JSON-inside-JSON, for the `\u002f` spelling of the same escape, and
// for `&#x2F;` in an attribute value.
//
// The causal chain, and it is the reason this file exists at all:
//
//     a hole in the DISCOVERY regex
//       -> a reference set that is missing a whole CLASS of references
//         -> pass 4 computes "reference set − disk set" over that short set
//           -> the closure gate reports "= ∅" AND IS GREEN.
//
// The gate did not fail to run. It ran, correctly, on an input that was already
// wrong — the same family as "the mirror needs its own gate" (mirroring.md
// §5.1): every downstream gate can be green because THE THING THEY MEASURE is
// the broken artefact. A gate's input can be the bug.
//
// Measured on objectandarchive.com (M(n)): reference set 1,360 -> 1,420. The 60
// invisible references included two woff2 that were referenced on three routes
// and never mirrored. Nothing downstream could catch it either — the host form
// does not render on any produced document, and an unrendered element makes no
// request (verification-gates.md §1.6 class 2), so the runtime gates were blind
// FOR A LEGITIMATE REASON. It was found by the closing per-asset copyright
// audit counting fonts, not by any gate.
//
// The fix is not "add two more regexes". Escapes COMPOSE with every other
// shape: an escaped srcset list inside a JSON-embedded HTML blob needs shape
// (4) to see through `\"` as well as `\/`. So the whole shape set is re-run
// over a decoded view of the text, and the two result sets are unioned.
// Over-inclusion is the safe direction here: a phantom reference makes this
// gate RED and gets one line in external.txt, while a missed class makes it
// GREEN and takes a copyright audit to find.
//
// Measured, differentially, over that project's 197 mirrored text files:
// 1,587 -> 1,767 references, ZERO lost. 121 of those are invisible even to the
// two-extra-regexes version of this fix, and they are why the decoding is a
// NORMALISING PASS and not a second alphabet of shapes: one string can carry
// TWO escape flavours at once. That site's JSON-LD spells an image as
//
//     "image":"https:\/\/host\/....jpg?v=1784637278\u0026width=1920"
//
// A shape written for \/ matches the head of that and then STOPS at the
// \u0026, because its class excludes backslash. So the reference does not go
// missing — it comes out TRUNCATED, as ...jpg?v=1784637278, and under a
// query-aware mapping (lib/urlpath.mjs) that is a DIFFERENT asset, which IS on
// disk. A half-understood escape turns a missing reference into a satisfied
// one: the gate stays green, holding a real file up as evidence for a claim
// about a different one. Escape flavour and escape depth are unbounded; the
// shape list is not.

// WHICH FILES GET SCANNED AT ALL — a gate's INPUT, not its assertion
// 【objectarchive N13 / D-T12】
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The shapes above answer "what does a reference look like?". This half answers
// the other question, and it is the one that went wrong: A REFERENCE THE
// EXTRACTOR COULD SEE IS STILL INVISIBLE IF NOBODY HANDS IT THE FILE.
//
// It used to be an EXTENSION WHITELIST copied into two scripts — the crawler's
// `TEXT_EXT` and the closure gate's `TEXT` — and both copies stopped at
// `html|css|js|mjs|json|svg`. Every other mirrored text format was a document
// neither side ever opened, and because BOTH sides shared the blind spot, the
// closure gate could not see it: "reference set − disk set = ∅" is computed
// over files the gate itself chose to read. Measured on objectandarchive.com
// (M0b): 16 `/collections/*.atom` feeds sat on disk, each an XML document full
// of product links and CDN image URLs in escaped `<content>` HTML, and neither
// the crawl nor the gate had ever read one. Reference set 3,109 -> 3,521.
//
// Same family as the prefix-matched excuse (verify-mirror.mjs's closure gate)
// and the escaped-URL blind spot above: NOT A WRONG ASSERTION, AN ASSERTION
// OVER A SHORT INPUT. When auditing any gate, ask how its input is delimited
// BEFORE asking whether its predicate is right.
//
// So the predicate lives here, next to the shapes, shared by both callers — and
// it is not an extension whitelist. Extensions are the origin's own naming
// choice and carry no promise (one origin serves woff2 bytes at a `.woff` URL);
// plenty of real routes have no extension at all. Three inputs, in order of how
// much they promise:
//   1. the DECLARED content-type (the origin's own statement — the oracle);
//   2. the extension (a hint, and the only thing available for an orphan file);
//   3. the bytes themselves (sniffed, for everything the first two cannot rule).
// Over-inclusion is the safe direction: scanning a binary as text costs one
// wasted regex pass, while skipping a text file costs a class of references
// that nothing downstream can recover.
