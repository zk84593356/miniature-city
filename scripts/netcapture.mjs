// netcapture.mjs — second mirror pass: drive the live site in a real headless
// Chrome, record every request it actually makes to the recorded hosts, then
// diff that against what the static crawler (mirror-site.mjs) pulled to disk.
//
// A regex crawl cannot see assets whose URLs are computed at runtime — scene
// textures built from an id, locale-suffixed sprites, media a component only
// requests once it mounts. This pass is how those get found.
//
// Zero npm dependencies: raw CDP over Node's built-in WebSocket (needs Node 22+).
//
// PORTS AND IDENTITY (scripts/lib/ports.mjs — read its header once): the debug
// port is allocated per (workspace, script) on the "live" side instead of a
// fixed 9333, a taken port is a loud exit, and the browser must be the one this
// script launched (sentinel page). Identity matters most here: this capture is
// the evidence base for the whole mirror, and a session that recorded another
// script's browser would produce a HAVE/GAP ledger for another program.
//
// BROWSER LIFECYCLE (scripts/lib/chrome.mjs — read its header once): Chrome is
// spawned as a detached PROCESS GROUP and the group is reaped on every exit
// path. `chrome.kill()` alone leaves the 6-8 renderer/GPU/network children
// running (measured: 129 orphans, oldest 2 days), and this pass is the one that
// runs longest and gets Ctrl-C'd most. Leaked renderers are not just untidy:
// downstream, the pixel gate derives its tolerance from the reference side
// compared with itself, so background load WIDENS that band and makes the gate
// forgive real differences.
//
// Usage:
//   node netcapture.mjs --origin https://example.com [--mirror mirror]
//     [--routes /,/about,/contact]      routes to visit (default "/")
//     [--viewports desktop,mobile]      which emulated viewports to run
//     [--steps 12] [--dwell 1500]       scroll-walk: wheel steps and per-step dwell (ms)
//     [--settle 9000]                   post-navigation settle before scrolling (ms)
//     [--hosts cdn.x.com,media.y.net]   extra hosts to record besides the origin
//     [--out <mirror>/netcapture.tsv]   HAVE/GAP ledger destination
//     [--fetch]                         also download anything the mirror is missing
//     [--swiftshader]                   opt-in software GL (see the Chrome flag list below)
//     [--cdp-port N]                    debug port; default allocated by lib/ports.mjs (CDP_PORT env also honoured)
//
// --hosts IS NOT OPTIONAL ON A CDN-BACKED SITE. Records are keyed by absolute
// URL over an allow-list of hosts, whose semantics match mirror-site.mjs's
// ASSET_HOSTS: pass this pass the same host list you passed the crawler. An
// earlier version filtered on startsWith(ORIGIN), so on a site serving its
// assets from a separate CDN host it recorded the HTML and nothing else and
// then reported a triumphant GAP=0 having observed ~2% of the traffic (field
// case: 208 of 246 URLs on cdn.shopify.com). Any host left off the list is
// counted and printed at the end, and running without --hosts while off-list
// traffic dominates prints a loud warning — a GAP=0 under that warning means
// nothing.
//
// The scroll walk dispatches WheelEvents AND window.scrollTo per step: covers
// both wheel-hijacking scene decks (advance one scene per wheel, then lock) and
// normal scroll pages. Dwell long enough for each newly mounted scene to start
// fetching, otherwise deep scenes' assets look like they do not exist.
//
// Adapted from careers-kimi-rebuild/legacy-mirror/_scripts/netcapture.mjs
// (samsyninja had the same real-browser capture idea; storytellingnoomo
// cross-checked with performance.getEntriesByType('resource'))
//   -> shopifydesign-rebuild (--hosts allow-list replacing the same-origin
//      filter, off-host census + under-observation warning, disk diff that
//      knows the assets/<host>/ layout).
