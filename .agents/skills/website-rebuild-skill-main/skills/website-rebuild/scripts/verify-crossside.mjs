/**
 * verify-crossside.mjs — ask BOTH sides the same question and compare answers.
 *
 * Most gates in this skill measure one side. That is a baseline, not a verdict:
 * a ported engine that is confidently wrong produces confidently stable numbers,
 * and a one-sided gate records them as the specification. This gate exists for
 * the case where the source publishes a seam you can drive directly — a global
 * class, a module you can reach, an exported function — so the mirror and the
 * port can be handed identical input and their outputs diffed.
 *
 * ⭐ Look for the seam before assuming there is none. A bundle that exposes no
 * `webpackJsonp` may still assign two or three globals as module top-level side
 * effects; grep the pretty-printed bundle for `window.<Name> =` and each hit is
 * a candidate. One seam through the orchestration layer (an expression parser,
 * a layout solver, an easing table) covers far more behaviour than its size
 * suggests, because everything else is specified in terms of it.
 *
 * Three failure modes this gate is built to avoid — all three were observed on
 * its first real run, and NONE of them was a porting defect:
 *
 *   1. It measured one side twice. Two CDP probes launched concurrently and the
 *      second attached to the browser the first started. ⛔ That failure REPORTS
 *      PERFECT AGREEMENT — the most convincing way for this gate to be wrong.
 *      Defences: evaluation is SERIAL, and every run fingerprints both sides and
 *      refuses to grade if the fingerprints match.
 *
 *   2. One side was missing a prerequisite action. A value read 0 on the port
 *      and 1080 on the mirror because the field is filled by a resize handler
 *      the probe page never triggers (gate-case-design.md §4). ⭐ This is
 *      the gate EARNING ITS KEEP: one-sided, 0 looks like the answer.
 *
 *   3. The two sides differ in measurement conditions, not in behaviour. Page
 *      coordinates differ because one page is 29,556px tall and the other 1,080.
 *      ⛔ Grading those as FAIL makes the gate red on every run, and a gate that
 *      is always red gets ignored. Hence two case lists:
 *
 *        judged  condition-independent — must match exactly
 *        info    condition-dependent   — printed, not graded, but BOTH sides
 *                                        must still resolve them (otherwise
 *                                        "unsupported" hides inside "expected")
 *
 * ⚠ Before adding a case, ask: does this quantity have the same domain on both
 * sides? Page size, scroll offset, timestamps, RNG seeds, devicePixelRatio and
 * anything derived from them do not — normalise them into ratios or file them
 * under `info`.
 *
 *   node scripts/verify-crossside.mjs --a <mirror-url> --b <port-url> \
 *        --config scripts/crossside.config.mjs [--probe scripts/probe.mjs]
 *
 * The config module supplies what is target-specific:
 *
 *   export const name   = "expression parser";
 *   export const judged = ["100vh", "(a0b - a0t) * 0.5"];
 *   export const info   = ["a0t", "a0b"];
 *   export function build(cases) { return `...JS returning {out:{case:value}}...`; }
 *
 * See crossside.config.example.mjs.

 * **跨侧门**：同一份输入同时喂镜像与移植，逐条比结果（站点侧写在 `crossside.config.mjs`，样例见 `crossside.config.example.mjs`）。用在源站**公开了接缝**时——bundle 没有模块注册表也可能有 `window.<Name> =` 这类模块顶层副作用，抓住编排层的那一个接缝，覆盖面远大于它的体积。⛔ 两侧**串行**求值，且每次运行给两侧取指纹、**URL 相同直接 FATAL**——并发探针会让第二个接到第一个拉起的浏览器，把一侧量两遍并报告**完美一致**。⛔ 用例分 `judged`（条件无关，逐字必须相同）与 `info`（条件相关，只打印但两侧都得解析得出来）
