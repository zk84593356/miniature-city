// urlpath.mjs — THE url -> local-path mapping. One implementation, shared by
// mirror-site.mjs (writes the bytes), netcapture.mjs (diffs against them),
// serve.mjs (reads them) and verify-mirror.mjs (audits them).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS — the collapse that turns every downstream gate green
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Each of those scripts used to carry its own copy of `localPathFor()`, and all
// of them keyed on `u.pathname` alone. On any site whose image CDN is a QUERY-
// PARAMETERISED TRANSFORM (Shopify, Cloudinary, imgix, Next/image, Wix, …) the
// query string is not decoration — it selects which bytes come back. Measured
// on objectandarchive.com (2026-08-13), one pathname, three responses:
//
//     /cdn/shop/files/x.jpg?v=1775999782&width=320     43,196 B
//     /cdn/shop/files/x.jpg?v=1775999782&width=600    163,064 B
//     /cdn/shop/files/x.jpg?v=1775999782&width=1200   328,321 B
//
// A pathname-only mapping lands all three on one file. The damage is SILENT,
// which is the whole point of this module:
//   - the mirror stops being a byte-level restatement of the origin's URL space
//     (mirroring.md §0), and inventory.tsv's sha256 describes whichever variant
//     happened to be written last — a race between crawler workers;
//   - the server answers every ?width= with that one file, so a srcset picks a
//     32px icon for a 1200px slot AND STILL RENDERS: the zero-404 gate, the
//     console gate and the zero-outbound gate all go green on a wrong mirror;
//   - the capture pass keys its ledger by url+search but resolves disk by
//     pathname, so every variant after the first reports HAVE. GAP = 0, falsely.
//
// Nothing downstream can catch this, because everything downstream asks "does
// it render?" and the answer is yes. That is why scripts/verify-mirror.mjs
// exists and why its first assertion is injectivity of THIS function.
//
// THE MAPPING
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   /cdn/shop/x.jpg?v=1&width=600   ->  cdn/shop/x@@v=1&width=600.jpg
//   /cdn/shop/x.jpg                 ->  cdn/shop/x.jpg
//   /collections/foo?page=2         ->  collections/foo@@page=2/index.html
//   https://cdn.other.com/a.js?b=1  ->  assets/cdn.other.com/a@@b=1.js
//
// The suffix goes BEFORE the extension so `path.extname()` keeps working —
// every consumer uses it for MIME selection and for the "is this a page?" test.
// Params are sorted, so two orderings of one request map to one file (transform
// CDNs are order-insensitive; verify with two byte-identical responses before
// relying on it). Filesystem-hostile or over-long suffixes degrade to
// `@@h<sha1-12>`: degrading on ANY hostile character rather than replacing it
// keeps the mapping injective — `?a=b/c` and `?a=b?c` would otherwise sanitise
// to the same name and re-create the collapse this module exists to prevent.
//
// POLICY — which params are part of the identity of the bytes
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Some params select bytes (`width`, `format`, `crop`); some are pure cache
// busters (`v`, `_`, `cb`) that produce identical bytes and, left in the key,
// merely store the same file twice. The default is DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE:
// **every param is part of the key**. Over-storing costs disk; collapsing costs
// correctness, silently. Narrow it per project only with evidence (two URLs
// differing only in that param, byte-identical responses):
//
//     node mirror-site.mjs --origin … --query-ignore v,cb        # drop busters
//     node mirror-site.mjs --origin … --query-only width,height  # keep only these
//
// The effective policy is written to <mirror>/urlpath-policy.json by the
// crawler and read back by serve/netcapture/verify-mirror, so the policy lives
// next to the bytes it produced and the four scripts CANNOT drift apart. A
// mirror written under one policy and served under another is itself a defect —
// verify-mirror.mjs reports it as MAPPING DRIFT.
//

// **唯一的 url→本地路径映射**，`mirror-site` / `netcapture` / `serve` / `verify-mirror` 四方共用（三方各存一份 `localPathFor()` 本身就是 bug 源）。**查询感知**：查询串排序后编成文件名后缀并插在扩展名前（`x.jpg?v=1&width=600` → `x@@v=1&width=600.jpg`），所以 `?width=320/600/1200` 是三个文件而不是一个；含文件系统敏感字符或过长的降级为 `@@h<sha1-12>`（**任何**敏感字符都降级，而不是替换成 `_`——替换会让 `?q=a/b` 与 `?q=a?b` 撞名，等于把要防的坍缩又造回来）。**策略可配置、默认保守**：默认每个参数都进键（宁可多存不可坍缩），确认某参数不改字节后再 `--query-ignore v,cb` 或 `--query-only width,height`；有效策略由爬虫写进 `<mirror>/urlpath-policy.json`，其余三方读它，四方不可能漂
