/**
 * lib/chrome.mjs — the child-process LIFECYCLE registry: launch, reap, sweep.
 * Every script in this directory that drives a browser over CDP goes through
 * here (probe.mjs, netcapture.mjs, pixelcompare.mjs, and any per-project gate
 * you copy from them), as does anything else that spawns a process which itself
 * forks (verify-routes.mjs's server under test — `npm run dev` execs node, so
 * killing npm leaves the server holding the port). Sibling of lib/ports.mjs:
 * that file answers "is this MY browser", this one answers "is my browser GONE
 * when I am gone".
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS — a leaked renderer LOOSENS THE PIXEL GATE
 * ===========================================================================
 * Every one of these scripts used to end with `chrome.kill('SIGKILL')`. That
 * kills the browser process and NOTHING ELSE: by then Chrome has already forked
 * 6-8 renderer/GPU/network/utility children, they are not in the signal's blast
 * radius, and when their parent dies they are reparented to pid 1 and keep
 * running. Field measurement (objectandarchive-rebuild, M(n-1)a instrument log
 * #5): 129 live Chrome processes across ~16 leaked profiles, the oldest 2 days
 * 1 hour old, load average 8.7 on a machine where "nothing was running".
 *
 * For this toolchain that is NOT a tidiness problem, because of what the pixel
 * gate's tolerance is made of. The gate does not carry a hand-picked epsilon;
 * it derives its band from the REFERENCE SIDE COMPARED WITH ITSELF — the same
 * ruler, the same checkpoints, the mirror photographed N times (N >= 4). Any
 * background load makes those N runs disagree with each other more, the band is
 * the disagreement, and the cross-side test is `cross <= selfBand(cp) + k`. So:
 *
 *     leaked renderers  ->  noisier reference side  ->  WIDER self-comparison
 *     band  ->  a LOOSER pixel gate that silently forgives real cross-side
 *     residuals — a false green manufactured by a process-teardown bug.
 *
 * The band is also invalidated by anything that changes mid-measurement, so a
 * leak that grows across the N sessions does not merely inflate the band, it
 * makes the N sessions incomparable. Reap before you measure.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * HOW IT IS FIXED
 * ===========================================================================
 *   1. PROCESS GROUP, NOT PROCESS. Chrome is spawned `detached: true`, which
 *      makes it a process-group (and session) leader; every child it forks
 *      inherits that group. Teardown signals the GROUP (`process.kill(-pid)`),
 *      so the renderers go with it. SIGTERM first, escalate to SIGKILL only
 *      after a grace period, so Chrome gets to close its profile cleanly.
 *   2. EVERY EXIT PATH, NOT JUST THE HAPPY ONE. The reaper is registered on
 *      'exit', SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, uncaughtException and
 *      unhandledRejection. The 'exit' handler must be SYNCHRONOUS — that is why
 *      the wait loop below uses Atomics.wait and not a Promise.
 *   3. A TEMPORARY, SELF-DESCRIBING PROFILE. Each launch gets its own
 *      `<tmp>/wrs-chrome-s<slot>-<role>-p<port>-XXXXXX` user-data-dir, deleted
 *      on teardown. The name is the identity handle: it is what makes "which of
 *      these 129 Chromes are mine" a decidable question at all, and it scopes
 *      the sweep so this file can never touch your real browser.
 *   4. A PRE-FLIGHT SWEEP. Before allocating a port, each script looks for
 *      ORPHANED instances of its own role from this workspace (ppid == 1, i.e.
 *      the script that launched them is dead), reports them loudly with their
 *      age, and reaps them. Orphan is the precise criterion: a live sibling run
 *      still has a live parent and is never touched — port allocation
 *      (lib/ports.mjs) is what adjudicates that case, loudly.
 *
 * CLI:  node scripts/lib/chrome.mjs            # list this workspace's instances
 *       node scripts/lib/chrome.mjs --all      # every workspace on this machine
 *       node scripts/lib/chrome.mjs --reap     # reap the orphans it lists
 *
 * Zero dependencies (Node 22+ builtins only).

 * a constant you can look up: on a second machine (Chrome 150, Node 22) an
 * inbound 3.33 M-char message came back fine while a 1728x1080 PNG of pure

 * the line you can rely on, not the line where it breaks.
 *
 * Rule of thumb: PNG stops arriving somewhere above ~1500x900 for photographic
 * content, and the failure is a SILENT HANG unless the socket's close is turned
 * into an error — which is why every CDP client in this directory installs an
 * onclose handler that rejects the in-flight calls AND a per-call timeout
 * (grep `close 1006`). A gate that hangs tells you nothing; a gate that names
 * the payload, the viewport and the format tells you what to change.
 *
 * jpeg q92 is the escape hatch and it is cheap: 58 ms per frame, and in the
 * field the byte-fidelity cost was measured, not assumed — two consecutive
 * shots of the same static state were byte-identical at that quality, so the
 * encoder introduced no noise of its own. Use PNG while it fits (byte-exact
